Mortality Prediction Rate in ICU using ANN.

Patients admitted to the ICU suffer from critical illness or injury and are at high risk of dying. ICU mortality rates differ widely depending on the underlying disease process, with death rates as low as 1 in 20 for patients admitted following elective surgery, and as high as 1 in 4 for patients with respiratory diseases. The risk of death can be approximated by evaluating the severity of a patientâ€™s illness as determined by important physiologic, clinical, and demographic determinants.


* The model has a loss of 0.27 and an accuracy of about 88%. This is the maximum accuracy it can reach with the given size of data.

* This model can be successfully used for predicting mortality in ICUs but then one should keep in mind that these values are just predicted values and the predictions can be wrong.
